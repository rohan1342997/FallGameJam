# FallGameJam

2d/3d: 2d Engine
Engine: Godot engine
Brainstorming:
- Bullet hell
- Prolonging death

- Like minit, death timer *
- Linear map *
- Layers, dying brings you down one *
- Strict timer *
- Platformer *
- Get power ups as you progress * (double jump, triple jump, dash)
- Higher difficulty as you progress *

- We could have all the Greek heros and stuff talk about how they thought they could cheat death
 in little dialog boxes as you pass them

Art style:
- Hand drawn art *
